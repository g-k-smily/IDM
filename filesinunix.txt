Unix File System
	
/ : 
	It is the root of the filesystem tree.
/bin : 
	It contains certain fundamental utilities, such as ls or cp, which are generally needed by all users.
/boot : 
	Contains all the files that are required for successful booting process.
	The boot process is something that happens every time you turn your computer on. 
	You don’t really see it, because it happens so fast.
	You press the power button come back a few minutes later and Windows XP, or Windows Vista, or whatever Operating System you use is all loaded.
	The boot loader is pulled into memory and started. The boot loader’s job is to start the real operating system.



/dev :
	 Contains file representations of peripheral devices and pseudo-devices.
/etc : 	
	Contains system-wide configuration files and system databases.
/home :
	 Contains the home directories for the users.
/lib :
	 Contains system libraries,files such as kernel modules or device drivers.
/media: 
	Default mount point for removable devices, such as USB sticks, media players, etc.
/mnt :
	 Stands for “mount”. Contains filesystem mount points. 
/proc :
	procfs virtual filesystem showing information about processes as files.
/root :
	The home directory for the superuser “root” – that is, the system administrator. 
/tmp : 
	A place for temporary files. Many systems clear this directory upon startup; 
/usr : 
	Originally the directory holding user home directories,its use has changed. It now holds executables, libraries.
usr/bin : 
	This directory stores all binary programs distributed with the operating system not residing in /bin, /sbin or (rarely) /etc.
/usr/include :
	 Stores the development headers used throughout the system. Header files are mostly used by the #include directive in C/C++ programming language.
/usr/lib : 
	Stores the required libraries and data files for programs stored within /usr or elsewhere.
/var :
	 A short for “variable.” A place for files that may change often – especially in size, for example e-mail sent to users on the system, or process-ID lock files.
/var/log : 
	Contains system log files.
/var/mail :
	The place where all the incoming mails are stored. 
/var/spool :
	Spool directory. Contains print jobs, mail spools and other queued tasks.
/var/tmp : 
	A place for temporary files which should be preserved between system reboots.


Types of Files:

1. Ordinary files:
	An ordinary file is a file on the system that contains data, text, or program instructions.
2. Directories:
	Directories store both special and ordinary files. For users familiar with Windows or Mac OS, UNIX directories are equivalent to folders
3. Special Files:
	Used to represent a real physical device such as a printer, tape drive or terminal, used for Input/Output (I/O) operations.
4. Pipes:
	UNIX allows you to link commands together using a pipe. 
	The pipe acts a temporary file which only exists to hold data from one command until it is read by another.
5. Sockets:
	A Unix socket (or Inter-process communication socket) is a special file which allows for advanced inter-process communication.
6. Symbolic Link:
	Symbolic link is used for referencing some other file of the file system.Symbolic link is also known as Soft link.
